# Project Proposal

**Table of content**

# 1. Introduction

In modern IT education, students often have to gather learning materials from multiple scattered sources such as YouTube, blogs, slides, and PDFs. This fragmented approach makes it difficult to follow a structured learning path and to apply knowledge in practice.
At the same time, instructors spend time manually designing quizzes and exercises, offering little interactivity or coding practice.

# 2. Problem statement

- Learning materials are **disconnected** and **lack structure**.
- Most platforms **lack interactive and hands-on practice**.
- Instructors spend time **manually creating quizzes and coding exercises**.

# 3. Solution

Develop **Learnix,** an AI-powered online learning platform for IT education, combining theory, coding practice.
Students can **learn and practice** **coding directly in the browser,** while instructors can **generate quizzes automatically using AI.**

# 4. Objectives

The main objective of **Learnix** is to create an intelligent and interactive e-learning platform for IT education that combines **structured learning**, **hands-on coding**, and **AI-assisted content creation**.

- **For Students:**
  - Learn from **structured and well-organized materials** including text, videos, and code examples.
  - **Practice directly** through an **embedded IDE** that allows writing, running, and testing code instantly.
- **For Instructors:**
  - Easily **create and manage courses, lessons, and quizzes** with AI support, saving time and effort.
  - Track student performance, quiz results, and engagement through an **analytics dashboard**.
- **For Administrators**
  - Provide tools to manage **users, roles, and system configurations** efficiently.

# **5. Competitor Analysis**

| Platform     | Strengths                                                                                     | Weaknesses |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Coursera** | - Provides structured, university-level courses with certifications and clear learning paths. |

- High-quality video content and well-designed user experience.
- Partnerships with top universities and global recognition. | - Learning is mostly **passive** - students mainly watch videos and read slides.
- **Limited hands-on coding**; practice often requires external tools.
- Subscription-based model can be **expensive** for students. |
  | **FreeCodeCamp** | - 100% **free and open-source**, accessible to everyone.
- Strong **practice-based** approach - coding directly in the browser.
- Large, active community for peer learning and discussion. | **- Linear content flow** with limited theoretical explanation.
- Minimal progress tracking and lack of instructor interaction.
- Assessment mainly based on task completion, not adaptive quizzes. |
  | **W3Schools** | - Very **simple, beginner-friendly** and easy to navigate.
- Quick **TryIt Editor** for testing code instantly.
- Great as a **reference tool** for syntax and examples. | - No instructor support |

# **7. Expected Impact**

The implementation of **Learnix** is expected to make a meaningful contribution to IT education by improving both **learning efficiency** and **teaching productivity**.

- **For Students:**

  Learnix provides a structured and interactive learning environment where students can study theory, practice coding, and test their understanding in one platform. This reduces the need to rely on scattered resources and helps learners build stronger programming skills through real-time practice.

- **For Instructors:**

  The platform simplifies content creation and assessment by using AI to generate quizzes automatically, allowing instructors to focus more on teaching quality and student engagement instead of manual tasks.

- **For Educational Institutions:**

  Learnix can serve as a modern, scalable platform to support blended or self-paced learning in programming courses, helping schools and universities modernize their teaching methods.

Overall, Learnix is expected to enhance **interactivity, accessibility, and efficiency** in IT education — bridging the gap between traditional e-learning and intelligent, hands-on learning experiences.

# 8. Conclusion

**Learnix** integrates AI-powered quiz generation and real-time coding to make IT learning more interactive and efficient.

It simplifies teaching for instructors and offers students a structured, hands-on learning experience. The platform marks a step toward smarter, more engaging digital education.
